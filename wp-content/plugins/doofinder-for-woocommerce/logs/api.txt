            [title] => Harry Potter Tour in Edinburgh
            [description] => Although most people think that Harry Potter was raised in London, it was actually in Edinburgh where he gave his first steps.
Since the author, J K Rowling, couldn't focus at home, she used to go to many coffee shops to write her novel. Sometimes, among long hours of writing, she would walk around the city of Edinburgh in search of inspiration.

Here you will discover the events that shaped the author's life, the places that she used to go and many more insights about the book.

The tour begins where Rowling finished, at the Balmoral Hotel, and walks around some of the most beautiful places in Edinburgh and their connection with Harry Potter.

Check the highlights to see what we'll cover in the tour!

            [title] => Edinburgh Old Town Tour
            [description] => In this guided walk around Edinburgh you will discover some of the most important landmarks, historical sites and secrets about Scotland's beautiful capital.

For example, did you know that the famous story of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was based on an Edinburgh criminal? And that the most visited tomb in the city is not the one of Adam Smith or David Hume, but a dog's tomb?  Or how a woman throwing a stool started a war? Incredible things happened in Edinburgh,  and this tour will show you those stories that shaped the city's character and its people.

            [description] => Whisky has had an incredible influence on the history of Scotland, but the history of Scotland has had a big influence on its whisky too! Throughout this tour, your excellent guide will take you through whisky’s history in Scotland and also demonstrate its importance.

We have carefully discussed and selected 4 whiskies from what are generally considered the 4 main whisky regions of Scotland. You will be able to enjoy a whisky from each of the following regions: Lowlands, Highlands, Speyside and Islay.

Each whisky brings its own taste and character. As a result, we find that each of our guests comes out of the whisky tour with a favourite region.

Don’t like whisky? We also have drink alternatives, including non-alcoholic drinks!

            [title] => Harry Potter Tour in Edinburgh
            [description] => Although most people think that Harry Potter was raised in London, it was actually in Edinburgh where he gave his first steps.
Since the author, J K Rowling, couldn't focus at home, she used to go to many coffee shops to write her novel. Sometimes, among long hours of writing, she would walk around the city of Edinburgh in search of inspiration.

Here you will discover the events that shaped the author's life, the places that she used to go and many more insights about the book.

The tour begins where Rowling finished, at the Balmoral Hotel, and walks around some of the most beautiful places in Edinburgh and their connection with Harry Potter.

Check the highlights to see what we'll cover in the tour!

            [title] => Edinburgh Old Town Tour
            [description] => In this guided walk around Edinburgh you will discover some of the most important landmarks, historical sites and secrets about Scotland's beautiful capital.

For example, did you know that the famous story of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was based on an Edinburgh criminal? And that the most visited tomb in the city is not the one of Adam Smith or David Hume, but a dog's tomb?  Or how a woman throwing a stool started a war? Incredible things happened in Edinburgh,  and this tour will show you those stories that shaped the city's character and its people.

We have carefully discussed and selected 4 whiskies from what are generally considered the 4 main whisky regions of Scotland. You will be able to enjoy a whisky from each of the following regions: Lowlands, Highlands, Speyside and Islay.

Each whisky brings its own taste and character. As a result, we find that each of our guests comes out of the whisky tour with a favourite region.

Don’t like whisky? We also have drink alternatives, including non-alcoholic drinks!

    [title] => Whisky and Folklore Edinburgh Tour
    [description] => Whisky has had an incredible influence on the history of Scotland, but the history of Scotland has had a big influence on its whisky too! Throughout this tour, your excellent guide will take you through whisky’s history in Scotland and also demonstrate its importance.

We have carefully discussed and selected 4 whiskies from what are generally considered the 4 main whisky regions of Scotland. You will be able to enjoy a whisky from each of the following regions: Lowlands, Highlands, Speyside and Islay.

Each whisky brings its own taste and character. As a result, we find that each of our guests comes out of the whisky tour with a favourite region.

Don’t like whisky? We also have drink alternatives, including non-alcoholic drinks! Alternatively you can also book the tour without drinks.

    [title] => Whisky and Folklore Edinburgh Tour
    [description] => Whisky has had an incredible influence on the history of Scotland, but the history of Scotland has had a big influence on its whisky too! Throughout this tour, your excellent guide will take you through whisky’s history in Scotland and also demonstrate its importance.

We have carefully discussed and selected 4 whiskies from what are generally considered the 4 main whisky regions of Scotland. You will be able to enjoy a whisky from each of the following regions: Lowlands, Highlands, Speyside and Islay.

Each whisky brings its own taste and character. As a result, we find that each of our guests comes out of the whisky tour with a favourite region.

Don’t like whisky? We also have drink alternatives, including non-alcoholic drinks! Alternatively you can also book the tour without drinks.
